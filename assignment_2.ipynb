        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5.why might you use a set instead of a list in python?\n",
        "  = sets only used unique element . if a collection must not contain duplicates, using set automatically removes the duplication of element .\n",
        "  - the operations for sets is significantly faster .sets are more efficients than than lists for storinf nondulicates elements .\n",

        "  - Strings are immutable, meaning  they   cannot be changed after they   are created.\n",

        "  In Python, tuples ensure data integrity by being immutable, which means once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
